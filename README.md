# Crime Scene Visualizing Through HoloLens

We suggest the application that novice user can replicate a crime scene by timeline
And Share it with other device users

## Motivation

Holograms offer more intuitive way for understanding the scene.
So by using this advantages with the Mixed Reality Hologram device HoloLens.
We suggest the application that novice user can replicate a crime scene by timeline
and Share it with other device users.

## Objective

We suggest the application that novice user can replicate a crime scene by timeline
And Share it with other device users.

## Functionality & Implementation

### Donwload the 3D object from web server
To Allow User to get the object they need at runtime. Runtime Object Loader is needed to 
### Set the 3D object position and add animation to create a scene

### Add Description of the screen and proceed the scene by order 

### Basic Figure of Scripting


### Multi Device Sharing 
Using Unity Photon a multi a networking framework for realtime Unity multiplayer games and applications. We built a network to share the Crime Scene Visulization Space. Photon also supports RPC, or Remote Procedure Calls, to specify a separate address space for remote control. So every user can join the process of Moving, Scaling , Adding Animation. To use a remote request in the method, a photon view script must be added to the target object to detect RPC proximity candidates. Thus, photon view script was remotely added to 3D objects right after it has been downloaded.
